# Determiners

## Demonstrative Determiners

Demonstrative determiners are used to point at something. In English, they are "this", "that", "these" and "those."

Spanish has three sets of demonstrative determiners, which vary by number and gender, so there are 12 in total:

| Masculine Singular	| Masculine Plural	| Feminine Singular	| Feminine Plural | 
| ------- | ------- | -------- | -------- |
| este (this)	| estos (these)	| esta (this)	| estas (these)| 
| ese (that)	| esos (those)	| esa (that)	| esas (those)| 
| aquel (that)	| aquellos (those)	| aquella (that)	| aquellas (those)| 

## Ese/Este versus Eso/Esto

It is important to note that the masculine singular forms in the table above don't end in "-o." The words "esto" (this) and "eso" (that) are also demonstrative pronouns, but they are gender neutral and used when the gender of the noun they refer to is unkown. For example, you would say "qu√© es eso?" (what is that?) when you don't know if the object you're asking about is masculine or feminine.

## Ese versus Aquel

Both "ese" and "aquel" and their related forms are translated to English as "that" or "those." However, they have slightly different meanings. "Ese" is more common, and usually refers to things that are closer in terms of distance or time. For example, "esos perros" would be "those dogs," whereas "aquellos perros" is closer in meaning to "those dogs over there."
